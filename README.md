- Firefox (111.0.1) [latest as of 5/2023]

## Installation
- As all the agents are recommended to create a new browser profile that uses their official email address (`agent@v5global.co.in`), in the same browser, they need to install this extension.
- Also, it is recommended to change your browser's main them to the official color of Zomato's branding i.e. `#e23744` to match with the theming of your dashboard. The steps for doing so are mentioned below:
    + **For Chrome**: `Click on 3 dots > Settings > Customise your chrome profile > The click on the color picker > Fill the following for RGB values: (R: 226, G: 55 and B: 68)`
    + **For Brave:** `Click on hamburger menu (3 lines) > Settings > Profile name and icon > Click on the color picker and fill the following for RGB values: (R: 226, G: 55 and B: 68)`
- After doing the above steps, either clone this repository if you have `git` installed by running `git clone https://github.com/AmaaelTyrneaMitore/OneDashboard.git`. Or you can also download this repository as a zip file by clicking _**[here](https://github.com/AmaaelTyrneaMitore/OneDashboard/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**_.
- After downloading, unzip it (_if downloaded it as a zip_). Now open your preferred browser, go to `Extensions (the jigsaw puzzle icon) > Click on Manage Extensions > Enable Developer Mode > Click on Load Unpacked > Now select the folder that you extracted` and __**VOILA!!**__
- Now, all you have to do is open a new tab to check if it is working or not.
## Feedback
- Now, of course this is the only one out there but not the best one because, well, what can you expect from a lunch time project that I coded in just 25 minutes?
- So, if you have any suggestions, feedback, feel free to reach out. And as for the contribution part, I actually have private repo that has the minified versions of the files. So, soon I might replace these with the original ones, but a huge advantage of using these minified files is that you're going to get a sooooper fazsht loading speed!!!
## Social
- You can reach out to me on my **Instagram** (`@sshashank790`) but if you are not able to find me with this handle, then that means that I've probably disabled my account for a short duration (_I very frequently get bored from the social media and its shenanigans_)
